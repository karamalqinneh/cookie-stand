            <h3>About Us</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="content"><p>The Humble Cookie Stand, LLC is an idea that came to be because of one determined baking-loving sister pestering her older sister to join her to help make her home-baking business grow.</p>
            <p> As we began working together on new ideas, we agreed that the best way to have a successful business was to promise that we would serve the highest quality products as possible.<br>  We also realized the best way to eat a cookie is right from the oven, baked fresh and served warm. And we couldn't think of a better cookie to enjoy warm from the oven than the chocolate chip cookie in all it's humble goodness.</p>   
            <p>So, we set out to create the most delicious chocolate chip cookie we could through research and a lot of taste-testing. The end result is a cookie that is made with the finest ingredients, including Belgium chocolate chips, and absolutely no preservatives. We fondly refer to our star cookie as our "Almost Famous Chocolate Chip Cookie".<br>  When served at an event right from our oven, we can promise that every bite will have that perfect crisp and gooey goodness that our customers deserve.<br>  And unlike over-sized gourmet cookies, we absolutely love our bite-size cookies for their perfect crisp to gooey ratio.<br>  When our warm cookies are paired with local dairy milk or ice cream that we serve at events, itâ€™s absolute cookie heaven!</p>
